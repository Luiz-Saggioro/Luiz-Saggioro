-My experience is mainly dealing with Data Science and Analytics. I consider myself "Technology Agnostic" in the sense that instead of looking first to my knowledge and then to the problems I can solve I first look at the problems I want to solve and then I turn to the technologies I need to learn to solve it. This way, I was able to learn multiple technologies and techniques.
